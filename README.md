# ResolveIT: Smart Grievance & Feedback Management System

**Project Title:** Online Complaint and Grievance Portal

## üìù Project Overview

ResolveIT is a modern, transparent, and efficient platform designed to handle user grievances and feedback within institutions. It allows users to submit complaints, track their status, and escalate unresolved issues, providing administrators with a robust system to manage the resolution process. The system is built to improve transparency and efficiency in complaint handling.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Outcomes

The platform includes the following core functionalities:

* **Submission Flexibility:** Users can submit complaints **anonymously or by logging into their account** (verified).
* **Evidence Upload:** Users can attach supporting evidence, including images or videos, to their complaints.
* **Status Tracking:** Complaints follow a clear, trackable status flow (**New ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Resolved**). Users can view a **chronological timeline** of all status changes.
* **Admin Management:** The Admin Panel allows staff to **assign complaints**, update their status, add **internal notes** (staff-only), and send **public replies** to users.
* **Escalation Logic:** Unresolved complaints that exceed a set time can be automatically **escalated to senior admins or designated higher authorities**.
* **Reports & Analytics:** Admins can view **visual dashboards** to monitor performance and recurring issues, and **export complaint data** (**CSV/PDF**) for audits and reporting.
